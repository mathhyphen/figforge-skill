Create a comprehensive scientific timeline figure showing GBM research evolution from 2010 to 2025 with detailed milestones:

TIMELINE STRUCTURE:
2010: TCGA Classification Era - Four transcriptional subtypes identified (Classical, Mesenchymal, Neural, Proneural). Brain tumor DNA helix icon.

2012-2015: Single-cell Revolution - scRNA-seq reveals intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Multiple cell state icons showing cellular plasticity.

2016: IDH Era - IDH mutation becomes diagnostic biomarker. Mutation marker icon with clinical significance note.

2018: Neftel Plasticity Model - Four cellular subgroups with transition states. Network graph showing plasticity mechanisms.

2021: WHO CNS5 Update - Integrated molecular classification. Three key markers: TERT promoter (red), EGFR amplification (orange), MGMT methylation (green).

2022-2024: Multi-omics Integration - Genomics + Transcriptomics + Epigenomics. Layered omics visualization.

2025: AI-Powered Multi-modal Era - Three interconnected data streams:
- Advanced Imaging: MRI sequences (T1/T2/FLAIR), PET, fMRI brain networks
- Digital Pathology: H&E whole slide images, IHC markers (GFAP, Ki-67, IDH1)
- Molecular Profiling: WGS, scRNA-seq, methylation arrays, proteomics

Show neural network connections between modalities converging to precision prognosis output.

STYLE: Professional scientific illustration with gradient timeline, detailed icons for each milestone, connecting arrows showing evolution, rich color palette (blues for early era, transitioning to vibrant multi-colors for modern era), white background, publication-ready quality.
