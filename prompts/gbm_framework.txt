Create a comprehensive research framework diagram showing the pipeline from current challenges to research objectives for GBM multimodal integration study:

TOP SECTION - CURRENT STATUS (Left side, red/orange warning theme):
Title: "Clinical Reality & Methodological Bottlenecks"
Three challenge boxes with warning icons:
1. Cross-scale Semantic Gap: MRI scan disconnected from molecular data, broken link symbol
2. Heterogeneous Missing Data: Incomplete data matrix with missing cells highlighted in red
3. Black Box AI: Neural network with lock symbol, no transparency
Bottom text: "Current approaches fail to bridge clinical translation gap"

MIDDLE SECTION - FOUR RESEARCH MODULES (Center, flowing pipeline design):
Large horizontal arrow connecting four modules left to right:

MODULE 1: Semantic Alignment (Blue theme)
- Input: Multi-modal raw data (MRI brain icon, pathology slide, DNA helix)
- Process: Medical LLM with semantic anchors, domain foundation model fine-tuning
- Output: Unified semantic embedding space
- Visual: Three data streams converging into shared representation sphere

MODULE 2: Missing Data Completion (Green theme)
- Input: Incomplete multi-modal data with missing indicators
- Process: Rectified Flow generative framework with prototype guidance
- Output: Virtual biopsy - completed data matrix
- Visual: Flow model generating missing data, "heterogeneity-aware" label

MODULE 3: Explainable Prediction (Purple theme)
- Input: Aligned and completed multi-modal features
- Process: Cross-modal Transformer with causal interpretability analysis
- Output: White box prediction with attention maps
- Visual: Transformer architecture showing attention weights on MRI and pathology regions

MODULE 4: Clinical Validation (Orange theme)
- Left: Multi-center retrospective validation (hospital icons, chart)
- Right: Prospective clinical testing (doctor, patient, real-time monitoring)
- Visual: Checkmarks and validation metrics

BOTTOM SECTION - RESEARCH OUTCOMES (Right side, green/success theme):
Title: "Paradigm Shift & Clinical Value"
Three outcome pillars:
1. Precision Prognosis: Brain MRI with survival curve overlay, high accuracy metrics
2. Clinical Decision Support: Doctor using AI interface, treatment recommendation
3. Paradigm Evolution: Arrow from "Experience-driven" to "Semantic-aware & Causal Decision"
Bottom banner: "From Experience-Driven to AI-Powered Precision Oncology"

CONNECTING ELEMENTS:
- Large curved arrows showing flow from Challenges → Solutions → Outcomes
- Progress indicators: Problem (red) → Method (blue-green) → Success (green)
- Side annotations highlighting innovation points

STYLE: Professional scientific framework diagram, clean modern design with gradient flows, distinct color coding for each module (blue/semantic, green/completion, purple/prediction, orange/validation), publication-quality icons and illustrations, white background, suitable for academic paper figure 1 or graphical abstract

TITLE: "Research Framework: From Methodological Bottlenecks to AI-Powered Precision Prognosis"
