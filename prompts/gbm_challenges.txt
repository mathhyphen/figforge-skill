TITLE: "Three Methodological Challenges in GBM Multimodal Integration"

CONTENT:
Three main challenges arranged in a triangular layout:

Challenge 1: Cross-scale Semantic Alignment
- Macro: Imaging (MRI, CT) - Tumor size, edema
- Gap: Semantic鸿沟 between macro and micro
- Micro: Molecular (Gene expression, mutations)
- Problem: Shallow feature concatenation cannot bridge the gap

Challenge 2: Heterogeneous Missing Data Imputation
- Complete data: Imaging + Pathology + Molecular
- Missing scenario: Imaging ✓, Pathology ✗, Molecular ?
- Problem: Simple interpolation destroys biological patterns
- Need: Missing-aware imputation preserving heterogeneity

Challenge 3: Multi-center Interpretable Validation
- Black Box: Deep multimodal network
- Gap: Traditional LIME/SHAP insufficient for cross-modal interaction
- White Box: Attention-based explanation
- Problem: Poor generalization across centers, lack of clinical trust

Center solution: Self-supervised Learning with Gated Multimodal Fusion
