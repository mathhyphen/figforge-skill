Create a comprehensive scientific diagram illustrating three major methodological challenges in GBM multimodal integration research:

CHALLENGE 1: CROSS-SCALE SEMANTIC ALIGNMENT
Top section showing two disconnected scales:
- LEFT: Macro Scale (blue theme)
  * Brain MRI scans (T1/T2/FLAIR sequences)
  * Tumor ROI visualization with edema and necrosis
  * Label: "Anatomical Imaging - Macro Phenotypes"
  * Features: Tumor size, texture, contrast enhancement patterns
  
- RIGHT: Micro Scale (green theme)  
  * DNA double helix with gene sequences
  * Single-cell RNA-seq heatmap visualization
  * Label: "Molecular Profiling - Micro Signatures"
  * Features: TERT promoter, EGFR amplification, MGMT methylation
  
- CENTER: Broken connection with red X
  * Dashed gap labeled "Semantic Gap"
  * Text: "Shallow concatenation cannot bridge scale differences"
  * Arrows trying to connect but failing

CHALLENGE 2: HETEROGENEOUS MISSING DATA IMPUTATION  
Middle section showing data completeness scenarios:
- Complete Data Case (green check):
  * Three connected icons: MRI ✓, Pathology slide ✓, DNA helix ✓
  * Label: "Complete Multi-modal Data"
  
- Missing Data Scenario (orange warning):
  * MRI ✓, Pathology slide with red X (missing), DNA helix with question mark
  * Label: "Partial Data Availability"
  * Common in clinical practice: 40-60% missing rates
  
- Imputation Problem (red error):
  * Matrix with missing cells being filled
  * Label: "Naive Imputation Destroys Patterns"
  * Biological heterogeneity lost in simple interpolation

CHALLENGE 3: MULTI-CENTER INTERPRETABLE VALIDATION
Bottom section showing explainability issues:
- LEFT: Black Box Model
  * Deep neural network layers (dark/gray)
  * Input: Multi-modal features
  * Output: Prognosis prediction
  * Label: "Black Box AI" with lock icon
  
- MIDDLE: Current Explainability Limitations
  * LIME/SHAP icons with warning signs
  * Text: "Single-modal explanations insufficient"
  * "Poor generalization across centers"
  
- RIGHT: Desired White Box Approach
  * Attention heatmaps on MRI
  * Attention on pathology regions
  * Molecular feature importance bars
  * Label: "Cross-modal Attention Explanation"

BOTTOM BANNER - OUR SOLUTION:
Purple banner spanning full width:
"Self-supervised Learning with Gated Multimodal Fusion"
Three key techniques with icons:
1. Cross-modal Attention Mechanisms
2. Missing-aware Imputation Networks  
3. Attention-based Interpretability

STYLE: Professional scientific illustration with distinct color coding (Blue=Macro, Green=Micro, Red=Problems, Purple=Solutions), clean separation between three challenges, publication-quality icons and diagrams, white background, clear typography suitable for academic paper.
