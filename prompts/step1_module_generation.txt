As an experienced scientific illustrator, your task is to generate a detailed English prompt for an AI image generator (such as Nano Banana) that will create a single, publication-quality scientific figure.

You must:

1. Thoroughly analyze the provided Scientific Text to understand the core concepts, processes, entities, and relationships.
    
2. Synthesize this information into a coherent figure design and describe it as a structured MODULE LIST.

OUTPUT FORMAT:  
MODULE LIST (Brief description of figure content):

1. Input(s):
    
    - [List input elements]
        
2. Preprocessing/Encoding/Embedding:
    
    - [List transformation modules]
        
3. Core Architecture/Stages/Blocks:
    
    - [List main components in exact sequence]
        
4. Special Mechanisms (if applicable):
    
    - [Attention/memory/routing mechanisms]
        
5. Output Head:
    
    - [Final output component]
        
Scientific Text:  
{scientific_text}
