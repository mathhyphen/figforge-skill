# GBM Multimodal Research Background

## Research Timeline
Create a timeline figure showing the evolution of GBM research from 2010 to present:
- 2010: TCGA classification - four transcriptional subtypes identified
- 2010s: Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals multiple transcriptional states
- 2021: WHO CNS5 update with key molecular markers (TERT, EGFR, MGMT)
- Recent: Neftel et al. characterized four cellular subgroups
- Current: Multi-modal integration era (Imaging + Pathology + Molecular)

Style: Scientific publication quality, clean timeline with colored nodes, professional medical research aesthetic.

## Three Methodological Challenges
Create a diagram showing three parallel challenges:
1. Cross-scale Semantic Alignment (Macro Imaging vs Micro Molecular)
2. Heterogeneous Missing Data Imputation (Complete vs Incomplete data)
3. Interpretable Validation (Black Box to White Box)

Style: Three-column layout with icons, arrows showing problem flow, modern scientific illustration.

## Multi-modal Hierarchy
Create a three-layer hierarchical diagram:
- Layer 1 (Top): Macro/Anatomy - MRI, CT, tumor morphology
- Layer 2 (Middle): Meso/Cellular - Histopathology, H&E, IHC
- Layer 3 (Bottom): Micro/Molecular - Genomics, TERT, EGFR, MGMT

Show bidirectional arrows between layers indicating influence relationships.

Style: Layered visualization with distinct colors (blue for macro, green for meso, purple for micro), clean connecting arrows.
