Scientific diagram: Three challenges in GBM multimodal research

CHALLENGE 1 - Cross-scale Alignment:
Left: Macro MRI imaging (brain scans, tumor morphology)
Right: Micro molecular data (DNA, gene expression)
Center: Broken connection showing semantic gap between scales
Problem text: Shallow concatenation fails

CHALLENGE 2 - Missing Data:
Top: Complete data (MRI + Pathology + Molecular all present)
Bottom: Incomplete scenario (MRI present, Pathology missing, Molecular unknown)
Problem: Simple imputation destroys biological patterns

CHALLENGE 3 - Interpretability:
Left: Black box deep network (locked, unexplainable)
Right: White box with attention maps (interpretable)
Problem: LIME/SHAP insufficient for cross-modal

SOLUTION BANNER at bottom:
Self-supervised Learning with Gated Multimodal Fusion

Style: Clean three-row layout, distinct colors per challenge, scientific icons, publication quality, white background
