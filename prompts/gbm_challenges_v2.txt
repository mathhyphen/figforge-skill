Scientific illustration: Three methodological challenges in GBM multimodal research

CHALLENGE 1 - Cross-scale Semantic Alignment:
Left panel shows brain MRI scans with tumor highlighted in blue (macro scale)
Right panel shows DNA helix and gene expression heatmap in green (micro scale)
Center shows broken connection with red X marking the semantic gap
Small text: Shallow concatenation fails to bridge scales

CHALLENGE 2 - Heterogeneous Missing Data:
Top row: Three complete icons - MRI scan, pathology slide, molecular data - all with green checkmarks
Bottom row: Incomplete scenario - MRI with check, pathology with red X, molecular with question mark
Arrow showing imputation attempt, with warning that naive methods destroy patterns

CHALLENGE 3 - Interpretable Validation:
Left: Dark neural network layers labeled "Black Box AI" with lock symbol
Right: Transparent network with attention heatmaps on brain MRI and highlighted pathology regions labeled "White Box Explainable AI"

BOTTOM SOLUTION BANNER:
Purple gradient banner with text "Self-supervised Learning with Gated Multimodal Fusion"
Three icons: attention mechanism, missing data handler, explanation module

STYLE: Clean modern scientific illustration, three horizontal sections, distinct color themes (blue-green for Challenge 1, orange-red for Challenge 2, black-white for Challenge 3, purple for solution), publication quality, white background, professional medical research aesthetic
