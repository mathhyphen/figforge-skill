You are an expert ML illustrator.  
Draw a clean, NeurIPS/ICLR-style scientific figure using Nano Banana Pro.  
  
GOAL:  
Create a professional, publication-quality diagram that exactly follows the  
structure and logic provided in the MODULE LIST below.  
Do not invent components, do not reinterpret, do not add creativity.  
Strictly follow the logical flow.  
  
GLOBAL RULES:  
  
- Flat, clean NeurIPS style (no gradients, no gloss, no shadows)  
- Consistent thin line weights  
- Professional pastel palette  
- Rounded rectangles for blocks  
- Arrows must clearly indicate data flow  
- No long sentences, only short labels  
- Keep spacing clean and balanced  
- All modules must appear exactly once unless specified 
- The background is pure white.
- There should be a continuous ring of pure white extending outward.
  
LAYOUT:  
  
- Horizontal left → right layout (recommended)  
- Or vertical top → bottom if modules are inherently sequential  
- Align components cleanly in straight lines  
- Respect the module order exactly as listed  
  
MODULE LIST:
{module_list}

NOTES (Optional but useful):  
  
- Specify any required two-branch or multi-branch flow  
- Specify "A and B must merge here"  
- Specify "keep this as a single tall block with submodules"  
- If experimental plot → replace section above with structured numbers  
  
STYLE REQUIREMENTS:  
  
- NeurIPS 2024 visual tone  
- Very light background  
- Text left-aligned inside blocks  
- Arrows short and clean  
- Use consistent vertical spacing  
  
Generate the final diagram.
